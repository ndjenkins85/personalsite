# Dynamic resume

Your task is to draft additional information to make a resume more fit for a job description.

You will be provided with the following information:

- Guidelines
- Current resume
- Relevant background information
- Target section
- Job description

Your output must conform to the following:

- Limit your response to at least four bullet points and at most six bullet points
- Ensure that the target section uses only relevant information from that specific job, or if it is requesting an overall summary, use all information
- Your response should not just reiterate what already exists in the current resume, instead it should aim to supplement or show additional perspective or additional capabilities
- Emphasize relevant skills, achievements, and responsibilities from my experience.
- Use language and terminology that closely match the job description.

## Guidelines

### Identify Required Skills & Keywords

Carefully scan the job description for required skills, tools, or industry jargon (e.g., “JavaScript,” “customer analytics,” “leadership”).
Ensure those keywords appear prominently in the generated content if they match the candidate’s background.

### Match Responsibilities & Achievements to Job Requirements

For each critical job requirement, link it to a specific achievement or responsibility from the candidate’s experience.
Use action-oriented language and quantify achievements (e.g., “Increased efficiency by 30%,” “Led a team of 4 engineers”).

### Highlight Relevant Experience Over General

Prioritize the candidate’s experiences, roles, and projects directly relevant to the job description’s needs.
Avoid burying important details under less-related tasks. Keep the emphasis on what directly addresses the job listing.

### Use Clear, Professional Formatting

Use bullet points for quick scanning and readability.
Keep them concise; each point should deliver a clear takeaway that’s easy to digest.

### Adopt the Employer’s Language & Tone

Reflect any terminology or preferred tone used in the job description.
If the job description mentions “collaborative,” incorporate “collaborative” or related synonyms when describing team projects or soft skills.

### Remove Irrelevancies & Redundancies

A “less intelligent” AI might include filler or repeat points. Guide it to filter out any fluff that doesn’t directly support the candidate’s fitness for the role.

### Present Strong Outcomes & Impact

Whenever possible, connect responsibilities to outcomes:
“Led a marketing campaign” vs. “Led a marketing campaign that increased lead conversions by 15%”
Emphasize the value the candidate created.
