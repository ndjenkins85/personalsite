# Dynamic resume

Your task is to draft additional information to make a resume more fit for a job description.

You will be provided with the following information:

- Output requirements
- Current resume
- Relevant background information
- Job description

## Output requirements

Emphasize relevant skills, achievements, and responsibilities from my experience.
Use language and terminology that closely match the job description.
It is essential that you take factual information from my work experience and not make up material or capabilities.

Your output must contain the following three sections

Summary supplement

Write an additional four sentences that specifically match the candidate's experience to the job role, do not reuse information already present in the resume summary.

TikTok supplement

Write an additional four dot points that specifically match the candidate's experience to the job role, do not reuse information already present in the TikTok work experience section.

Boston Consulting Group supplement

Write an additional four dot points that specifically match the candidate's experience to the job role, do not reuse information already present in the BCG work experience section.

## Guidelines

### Identify Required Skills & Keywords

Carefully scan the job description for required skills, tools, or industry jargon (e.g., “JavaScript,” “customer analytics,” “leadership”).
Ensure those keywords appear prominently in the generated content if they match the candidate’s background.

### Match Responsibilities & Achievements to Job Requirements

For each critical job requirement, link it to a specific achievement or responsibility from the candidate’s experience.
Use action-oriented language and quantify achievements (e.g., “Increased efficiency by 30%,” “Led a team of 4 engineers”).

### Highlight Relevant Experience Over General

Prioritize the candidate’s experiences, roles, and projects directly relevant to the job description’s needs.
Avoid burying important details under less-related tasks. Keep the emphasis on what directly addresses the job listing.

### Use Clear, Professional Formatting

Use bullet points for quick scanning and readability.
Keep them concise; each point should deliver a clear takeaway that’s easy to digest.

### Adopt the Employer’s Language & Tone

Reflect any terminology or preferred tone used in the job description.
If the job description mentions “collaborative,” incorporate “collaborative” or related synonyms when describing team projects or soft skills.

### Remove Irrelevancies & Redundancies

A “less intelligent” AI might include filler or repeat points. Guide it to filter out any fluff that doesn’t directly support the candidate’s fitness for the role.

### Present Strong Outcomes & Impact

Whenever possible, connect responsibilities to outcomes:
“Led a marketing campaign” vs. “Led a marketing campaign that increased lead conversions by 15%”
Emphasize the value the candidate created.
