RE: -JOB TYPE- with -COMPANY-

Paragraph to introduction to my career and skills, maximum of five sentences.

Paragraph to link my skills and experience to the job description, maximum of five sentences.

Closing call to action.

Regards,
Nick Jenkins

## Guidelines

The two paragraphs should contain the following sections

- Introduction to my career and skills
- Why I would be a good match for the job

### Identify Required Skills & Keywords

Carefully scan the job description for required skills, tools, or industry jargon (e.g., “JavaScript,” “customer analytics,” “leadership”).
Ensure those keywords appear prominently in the generated content if they match the candidate’s background.

### Match Responsibilities & Achievements to Job Requirements

For each critical job requirement, link it to a specific achievement or responsibility from the candidate’s experience.
Use action-oriented language and quantify achievements (e.g., “Increased efficiency by 30%,” “Led a team of 4 engineers”).

### Highlight Relevant Experience Over General

Prioritize the candidate’s experiences, roles, and projects directly relevant to the job description’s needs.
Avoid burying important details under less-related tasks. Keep the emphasis on what directly addresses the job listing.

### Use Clear, Professional Formatting

Use bullet points for quick scanning and readability.
Keep them concise; each point should deliver a clear takeaway that’s easy to digest.

### Adopt the Employer’s Language & Tone

Reflect any terminology or preferred tone used in the job description.
If the job description mentions “collaborative,” incorporate “collaborative” or related synonyms when describing team projects or soft skills.

### Remove Irrelevancies & Redundancies

A “less intelligent” AI might include filler or repeat points. Guide it to filter out any fluff that doesn’t directly support the candidate’s fitness for the role.

### Present Strong Outcomes & Impact

Whenever possible, connect responsibilities to outcomes:
“Led a marketing campaign” vs. “Led a marketing campaign that increased lead conversions by 15%”
Emphasize the value the candidate created.
