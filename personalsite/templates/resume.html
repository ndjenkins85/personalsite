<p>
I am an Australian Data Scientist working at BCG Gamma in NYC. I help organizations get value from their data. I believe successful data science projects start with a good understanding of the business problem, and choosing an appropriate technical approach to match. I champion these skills in myself and in team environments. 
</p>

<p>
I joined The Boston Consulting Group in July 2019 as a Senior Data Scientist. During my time at BCG I have developed into a ‘full stack’ data scientist - able to manage and execute programs end-to-end from inception, to technical implementation, to client enablement. My focus has been on pricing and personalization related projects in the marketing and services practice. We use data science to provide the right offer, to the right person, at the right time. In addition to client facing projects, I was also selected for internal projects to assist case teams with data science best practices, and internal consulting for our data products.
</p>

<p>
During my time at BCG, we have employed several analytic strategies to solve our client's business problems. I am frequently involved in managing data assets, creating configuration driven machine learning pipelines, and setting up and measuring experiments. Techniques include regression, classification, demand forecasting, segmentation, unstructured ML techniques (NLP).
</p>

<p>
In April 2019 I completed a Masters of Computer Science from Georgia Tech, majoring in Machine Learning. This degree improved my rigor in software development. Topics covered included; statistics, deep learning, AI, big data, database design, and algorithms.
</p>

<p>
At my previous employer based in Melbourne - Evolve Research - these skills helped solve data problems in the market research industry. I was the Head of Data Science for three years, with five years prior as a market research consultant. I led a team of junior analysts, graduates and software engineers to deliver analytical solutions to in-house consultants or direct to ongoing client relationships. Our section also included scope for R&D work to find opportunities to apply innovation in our industry.
</p>

<p>
During my time at Evolve, we created an innovative chatbot application to enhance respondent engagement. This project was selected in response to more demand for shorter more text based surveys. This approach has been successfully rolled out to multiple clients for different use cases.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, we deployed a python API to serve the chatbot to our in-house survey software. This effort required a combination of data science skills, software engineering, cloud hosting, and web technologies to serve the analytical solutions. We extended this into another proof of concept to serve consultant analysis requests through a self-service web interface.
</p>

<p>
We created tools for a major retailer to identify when respondents had feedback on particular items as it related to stock issues, quality, price, and other ‘hot topics’. Here, the hot topics were always respondent generated such as capturing additional chatter about holiday seasons or extreme weather. This information helped our client identify stores with poor quality products or those which were providing exceptionally good service. 
</p>

<p>
On the technical side, these projects required a range of skills such as secure website and API development, dashboard and docker solutions on Azure. Our NLP approach utilized LSTM neural networks for sentiment scoring and entity detection, and enhanced dictionary approaches for chatbot and AI routines.
</p>

<p>
Before Evolve I worked at The Klein Partnership (TKP), a market research agency in Melbourne. At TKP and Evolve I worked across multiple industries in a quantitative and qualitative research capacity. 
</p>

<p>
I joined TKP after graduating from The University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts, having studied a double major in Psychology and Political Science. These studies greatly expanded my world view, ability to communicate complex ideas and contributed to my interest in travel. Over the past few years my partner and I have lived and worked remotely, which has developed my capabilities to work and lead asynchronously with a mix of teams.
