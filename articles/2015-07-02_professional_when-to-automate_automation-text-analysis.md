While performing some github repository cleaning in May 2020, I found a collection of blogs from my first blog site which I didn't stick with. This article links to a presentation on automation - benefits and reasons not to.

## Show and tell

I recently had a show and tell with my colleagues at Evolve research.

The talk focused on current techniques, when to automate, and potential opportunities for the business.

This was put together in prezi, with interactivity of presentation being a key consideration.
