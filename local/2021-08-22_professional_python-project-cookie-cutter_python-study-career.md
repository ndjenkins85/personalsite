Since beginning of COVID I have spent considerable time learning about better practices for python codebase development.
I have recently put together a project cookie-cutter intended to help me quick start projects.

The cookie-cutter repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ndjenkins85/ndj_cookie).

The cookie-cutter includes the following tools:

* Handy git files i.e. gitignore, codeowners, templates, github actions
* Initial documentation README, standard git docs, sphinx documentation
* Automations including pre-commit, nox
* Dependency and virtual environment management with poetry, (conda) or (docker-compose)
* Warmed up project example with logging, imports, and argparse
