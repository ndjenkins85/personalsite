Heading into the second half of 2020, one of my professional goals is to improve my software development expertise. I want to implement best practices in my projects and continue learning about new approaches.

##### I think there are several things I'm doing well such as:

* Well structured project READMEs with
    * Project overview
    * Environment setup / Requirements
    * Example script snippets to run programs
    * Explanation of data and program structures
* Documentation
    * Filestrings, docstrings
    * Using comments to help explain why design choices were made
    * Precisely named variables
* Code structure
    * Plaintext (YAML) configuration
    * Argparse into a program runner
    * Python definitions
    * Shared utility functions
* Git usage
    * Pull requests
    * Branching, Git flow
    * Gitignore

##### There are also several areas I'm looking to improve:

* CLI tooling such as Click instead of argparse
* Dependency management
  * Have used conda, pip and some venv
  * Move to using poetry, docker and dockercompose
* Logging, learn proper usage
* Code linting i.e Black
* Global configs and environment setting

##### Beyond the above, there other areas I'm looking to learn such as:

* Catching up on the latest with Flask
* Airflow
* Pyspark
* Spinning up infrastructure EC2, EMR, S3
* Git advanced usage
* CI and testing (Great Expectations)

## How I will improve expertise

The best way to improve expertise in these areas is with practice. Ideally I would have work situations where I can focus on implementing one new skill at a time. 

When work is quiet, I will instead focus on learning these skills and applying them to my personal projects. There are a few personal projects I have been hacking around with recently including:

* Wow_auctions - An application that analyses game data from World of Warcraft to inform pricing policies for auctioning items
* personal_site - This website
* Otsukare - A website developed during masters degree to help users study Japanese language learning

I will be creating and releasing some further articles over the next few days to elaborate on the above plans further.
