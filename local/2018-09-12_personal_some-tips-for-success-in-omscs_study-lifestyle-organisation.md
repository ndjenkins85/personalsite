I'm 8 classes in, and my couple of tidbits of advice specifically for Georgia Tech would be the following 5 tips.

1) Front load as much work as you possibly can
By this I mean start assignments/projects from the day they are released. Look to take the lectures as soon as possible. Course structure is as times more flexible than on campus, in particular with things like exams. You will need the time up your sleeve when you have personal or work commitments, or when the subject starts getting more difficult

2) When you don't understand something, reach out for help
Utilise the office hours, slack channels and piazza. This is especially important in highly technical subjects (such as reinforcement learning). For these sorts of subjects, try to communicate with other highly social people on the slack channels and help each other

3) Be strategic in how you organise your subject learning
For this subject for example, each assignment related to a series of lectures, and those lectures contributed to the exams. Also, the first exam subject material is highly associated with the project. If you can get a sense of the synergies between gradable parts of the subjects, you can put more effort towards those areas. My notes from Exam 1 have been invaluable for the project. When preparing for each exam, I put particular effort into the assignments close to those exams, so I could utilise and learn the concepts at the same time

4) It's a marathon, not a sprint
For those like me taking a subject per semester, you will be doing this for over three years. On top of that, Georgia Tech is infamous for having a very low number of holidays. Pace yourself, take the time to look after yourself, keep your work and homelife in order. Try to have the support of friends, family, colleagues and your boss. There's been one or two cough sick days in this masters degree, correlating to some particularly stressful periods :) Along with that, be honest with those close to your in your life about your study commitments. A few times i've been wiped out entire back to back weekends. It's ultimately rewarding though!

5) Beware the bureaucracy
While this course is high value and low cost, there are some elements that can bite you if you're not careful and organised. This is mainly because there is a very large cohort of people and less funding and time to manage individual issues. Some specific advise here is be very careful and deliberate with course selection / waitlists - not doing so could result in missing out a preferred subject for a semester. Be careful to always submit the right work in a timely fashion. Professors and TAs are usually (and understandably) unforgiving of this, especially at the end of semester where they need to submit grades (and then regrade and rechange them). Often TA's will quit meaning grades are slower coming back, expect most of your performance during a subject will be 'blind'.

Hey, this is kind of like David's 5 tips for HCI :)
