Well, seems my last blog about thing I'd like to do in NYC has been blown to bits by COVID. While in lockdown, I've been going through my reading list and curating some good content that I have come across over the years.

## The list

I have looked to group by a couple of key areas:

* Management and process
* Processes and checklists
* Machine learning
* Metrics
* Text analysis
* SQL
* Web
* Data quality

Each specific article link starts with header, provides link, some tags, then a brief description of the content of the article.

It might be cool to perform a site update to have a separate section for reading list. It would also be cool to have the tags which I currently have set up for blogs could include these tags, and be sorted alphabetically.
