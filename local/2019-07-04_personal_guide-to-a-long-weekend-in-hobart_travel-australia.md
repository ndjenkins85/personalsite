Hobart has been a destination for some great weekend trips over the years. Very accessible from Melbourne, and with low cost airlines making it easy and cheap to visit, it’s likely a destination we’ll continue to visit every so often. I’ve been wanting to jot down some notes on ideas for people taking holidays there, so this article will list some top picks.

On top of this list of places we’ve personally experienced, keep in mind that Hobart has regular festivals. There are more day trips and attractions not covered such as Cradle Mountain and Port Arthur.

### Day 1, Salamanca, Posh pit, Mona
If I only had one day, I’d do it exactly like this. Salamanca place to have a look around, visiting the Machine laundry cafe for a great breakfast or brunch. Then stroll over to the pier to get your tickets for a ferry to Mona around 10:30-11am. Make sure to get your tickets for the Posh Pit on the boat - it adds a special touch to the day where you’re treated to drinks and canapés both ways. Mona is a reason to visit Hobart all to itself. The exhibitions often change and a relaxed day spent walking between exhibitions is well spent.

### Day 2, Mt. Wellington, Cascade Brewery
Mt. Wellington towers over Hobart, and in winter months can be snow-capped. There are several hiking trails around the peak, but it’s also straightforward to drive to the summit. You can enjoy the view, read about the history and walk across the upper plateaus. As part of this trip, work in a trip to the Cascade Brewery, one of Australia’s oldest breweries. You can do a brewhouse tour which takes you around a classic building with all of the modern machinery and techniques. I personally learnt a lot about the brewing and hops process and enjoyed it. Afterwards, head to the nearby bar and restaurant. In summer the gardens are beautiful and worth stopping for a drink on the way home. For both the tour and bar, it’s worth calling ahead to see if you need to book.

### Day 3, Bruny Island
Bruny Island is another day trip not far from Hobart. It involves a ferry crossing and further driving down the island, taking in the various sites including ‘The Neck Lookout’. Head to Adventure Bay for some great walking trails which takes you up the cliffs of the island and into the untouched bushland. If you’re visiting in summer, supposedly these are some of the best beaches in the world (when the weather is right). On the way back to the ferry, score some fresh Oysters from the roadside ‘drive-thru’.

### Day 4, Mount Field, The Winston
We took a day trip out to Mount Field, which is an excellent destination for short, medium or longer walks. It’s about an hour and a half drive from Hobart, and there are several 2 hour walks that take you around some very large ancient trees and waterfalls. The drive itself is very scenic and easy driving. In the evening, head up to The Winston pub. It’s a traditional pub that is very lively with a modern menu. It has a big bar with array of beers. Unless you’re seriously game, avoid the super hot chicken wings, I learnt that mistake the hard way.
