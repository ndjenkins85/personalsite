TODOs

* Understand dockerfiles and docker-compose better. I want to be able to run docker and have files update (and for flask to reset), then, easily changeover for prod
* I want to abstract out the article source information to how the site displays the blogs better. Currently doing hardcoded files that are provided along with docker, but i want to be able to point to any file sources (S3 bucket, or an email inbox)
* Automatically link to related articles based on tags
* Create an RSS feed
* Pagination
